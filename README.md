# Well Howdy There!
I'm Tay, better known on The Interwebz<sup>:tm:</sup> as SteelStarling! I'm a senior in the Software Engineering - Space Track program at [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University - Prescott](https://prescott.erau.edu/), also studying rocket propulsion, mathematics, and some more miscellaneous nonsense, as well as an aspiring Vim user. Along with doing serious programming things<sup>[<ins>\[citation needed\]</ins>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)</sup>, I love [obscure technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OfxlSG6q5Y), [dumb units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_humorous_units_of_measurement), and [esolangs](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language).

This profile is where you can find all my nonsense that isn't locked behind proprietary information rules, NDAs, or ITAR (p.s. the government, if you're reading this, I will not post ITAR here, I rather value not being in federal prison so I can keep doing my dumb nonsense :3).
